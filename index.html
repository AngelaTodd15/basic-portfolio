            <p class="right">Welcome to my online resume. Why keep it to one page when there's so much more to be said?
                On this site, you'll be able to gain a more in-depth look at my work experience, skills,
                and writing portfolio.</p>
                

            <p class="clear"> I began my college career as a marketing major. I became interested in the field during my
                high school graphic design class, where we created posters and flyers for school events and
                student organizations. I found that graphic design was the only class where time seemed to fly
                by while I worked and I loved seeing my finished projects around the school. Nothing was cooler
                than pointing to the poster for prom and telling everyone, "I did that."</p>
                <br><br>
            <p>As I enrolled in more and more business classes at ECU and learned about the many aspects of marketing,
                it become clear to me that my passion for the field lied with writing and the creative side of
                communications. The summer before the start of my senior year I made the bold decision to change my
                major.
                I switched to Communications, with a concentration in public relations and my time at the College of
                Business
                has earned me a minor in Business Administration. My graduation date was pushed back, but this is one
                of
                the best decisions I&apos;ve ever made. I have been able to grow and learn in ways that were not
                possible under
                my previous major. Most significantly, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to do more of what I love most:
                writing.</p>
