    <p>Welcome to my online resume. Why keep it to one page when there&apos;s so much more to be said? 
        On this site, you&apos;ll be able to gain a more in-depth look at my work experience, skills, 
        and writing portfolio.</p>

    <p> I began my college career as a marketing major. I became interested in the field during my 
        high school graphic design class, where we created posters and flyers for school events and 
        student organizations. I found that graphic design was the only class where time seemed to fly 
        by while I worked and I loved seeing my finished projects around the school. Nothing was cooler 
        than pointing to the poster for prom and telling everyone, &quot;I did that.&quot;</p>
            
    <p>As I enrolled in more and more business classes at ECU and learned about the many aspects of marketing,
         it become clear to me that my passion for the field lied with writing and the creative side of 
         communications. The summer before the start of my senior year I made the bold decision to change my major. 
         I switched to Communications, with a concentration in public relations and my time at the College of Business
          has earned me a minor in Business Administration. My graduation date was pushed back, but this is one of 
          the best decisions I&apos;ve ever made. I have been able to grow and learn in ways that were not possible under
         my previous major. Most significantly, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to do more of what I love most: writing.</p>
            
    <p>As I&apos;ve ventured into the professional world, my love for the marketing/communications field has only grown. 
        I&apos;m excited to see where my career will take me and curious to explore many different aspects of my chosen field.</p>
